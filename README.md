This is a JavaScript based Jump And Run game with a lot of flexibility to customise levels.


The project uses Node.js and React. To start hacking the game (e.g. to add new levels) you need to:

*   Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 8 or 10 will do)
*   Run `npm install` to install the required node packages
*   Run `npm start` to build the app
*   Wait until a browser opens and enjoy :) 

Have fun :)
